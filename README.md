## MASTERMIND 

Mastermind is a fast, simple strategy game--one of the bestselling games of all time! There are more than 2,000 possible combinations which make the game different every time it's played. Players take turns setting secret codes and solving the codes uses STEM and STEAM principles along with deductive reasoning and logic.
For ages 8 and up.

## How to play?

Try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten turns. After submitting a row, a small black peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
